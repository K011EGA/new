I was six feet under for the one and only
Spent the nights feeling bitter, sad and lonely
Didn't realise how much fear controlled me
Until you came and loved me like I'm holy
Now I'm ready to give life one more chance

Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, I must confess
Say yes, say yes, say yes
Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, I must confess
Say yes, say yes
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
